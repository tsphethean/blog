A seemingly simple question that can strike fear into the heart of many developers,
estimation is both essential and fruitless at the same time. As a developer, you might
feel you can never win - always asked to do things quicker - whilst a project manager
usually wonders why developers estimates are inaccurate. In this post I hope to share
some techniques that have helped me along the way, and might keep the questioning PM at bay.

#### It's only an estimate



#### Never answer right away

How many times have you been asked how long something would take, maybe
in your daily standup, and quickly responded "by the end of the day", "end of the week", or similar,
without really thinking the estimate through? Sometimes you might get lucky and things pan out ok,
but many times these instinctive estimates don't think through the problem properly and
often take longer than first given.

Now that's fine, it was only an estimate after all, but you've set an expectation and in all likelihood
you're going to work extra hours to make it happen to avoid disappointing someone.

The best tip I ever read, came from reading [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer),
and went something like:

> "You almost always get better results if you slow the process down... Estimates given at the coffee
machine will come back to haunt you."

#### Break down the task

#### List your assumptions

#### Look back

One of the number one criticisms of estimation is that we never learn from our bad estimates,
and so never improve our accuracy. In many ways, this is a false accusation because as we've
seen no estimate is created equal, however there is something to be said for looking back and
comparing your estimate with your actual, and making note of the reasons.
