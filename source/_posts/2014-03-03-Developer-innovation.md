I recently read an interview with Adam Gunther, Program Director of Cloud
Offerings with IBM, which contained some incredibly relevant quotes. It was
interspersed with the usual IBM sales pitches (I can't blame IBM, any other
company would do the same), but removing
the specifics of the product information and listening to the core messages
really resonated with me.

> "Developers are where innovation happens...It happens with a developer, sitting
behind a desk somewhere, having his coffee and coming up with an idea. When you
have a small idea like that, how do you iterate and turn it into business value?"

> "The API economy it’s really where it’s at. In forty years
the new generation of developers will not even understand the concept of
‘installing software’.”

> "Like anything as a service exposed through APIs, I can call in the
cloud very easily. I don’t have to set up a database or administer it, I don’t
need to get a bunch of hardware and deploy it, and I don’t have to worry about
how do I scale the infrastructure"

> "It’s all about elasticity. People want to deploy things without thinking about it."

> "It comes down to enthusiasm. Obviously they will have technical skills, but
get someone that is enthusiastic, has a passion and wants to build things and
experiment. These developers will go into these platforms, look at a combinations
of services and think of new things that no one has ever thought of. And that’s
what people want, in order to innovate and move the business forward.”
