One of the most common code review comments I write is "needs unit tests". The trouble with this, is that
once the code is written it's very easy to write unit tests which pass, but either don't go into the heart of
whether the tests are valid, or don't cover all of the possible scenarios. In these instances, the tests are almost
more dangerous than useful - because they give a false confidence that because the tests are green the
code behind them must be ok.

A lot of the time, we can reduce these risks by considering the tests firsts and following Test Drive Development (TDD).
What I hope to show below is how you might approach a problem from a test driven perspective, and how that can
help you think more deeply about what your code needs to do, and what weaknesses there may be. I should point out
however, that I'm far from a TDD "expert" and am almost using this post as a test of my thoughts - so any feedback
or comments would be very welcome.

If you've read my recent post on [manipulating dates with PHP](/blog/2014/01/22/PHP-Date-Fun) then
 the examples below will be very familiar. In short, I want to be able to add months to a date, and reliably
 get the new date. Read the original post if you want to know why this is more difficult than it sounds...

So we start with just a test, trying to instantiate a hypothetical DaleCalc class.

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
      public function testAddMonths() {
        $date_calc = new DateCalc();
      }
    }

    phpunit --testsuit DateCalcTest DateCalcTest.php
    PHPUnit 3.7.19 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    PHP Fatal error:  Class 'DateCalc' not found in ~/Sites/dates/DateCalc.php on line 7

Create our DateCalc class:

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
      public function testAddMonths() {

        $date_calc = new DateCalc();
      }
    }

    class DateCalc {
      public function __construct() {

      }
    }

    phpunit --testsuit DateCalcTest DateCalcTest.php
    Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 4.25Mb
    No tests executed!

Now we need to think about what we're wanting our class to do. In this case, we know that we want to add
a number of months to a given date, so we're going to want to have a test passing in a date to the class
constructor, and then make sure we can get it back out again:

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {

      public function testAddMonths() {
        $test_date = '2014-01-01';
        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);
        $date = $date_calc->getDate();
        $this->assertEquals($date, $test_date);
      }
    }

    class DateCalc {

      public function __construct() {

      }
    }

    phpunit --testsuit DateCalcTest DateCalcTest.php
    PHPUnit 3.7.19 by Sebastian Bergmann.

PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method DateCalc::getDate() in ~/Sites/dates/DateCalcTest.php on line 11

Looking at our emtpy class it's obvious this is going to fail, so  we need to sort out this undefined
method and make sure we're handling our constructor correctly:

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {

      public function testAddMonths() {
        $test_date = '2014-01-01';
        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);
        $date = $date_calc->getDate();
        $this->assertEquals($date, $test_date);
      }
    }

    class DateCalc {

      public function __construct($date) {
        $this->date = $date;
      }

      public function getDate() {
        return $this->date;
      }
    }

    phpunit --testsuit DateCalcTest DateCalcTest.php
    OK (1 test, 1 assertion)

Excellent, now we're making progress. We can now instansiate our class, pass in a date, and get a date
back out of it, and assert that we haven't done anything to it to modify it. Now we start to get to the
heart of the issue we wanted to solve - adding months to our date and finding out the value. So we go back to
our test, and refactor. I'm going to add a call to a new method "addMonth" which from previously you'll see
will immediately throw a fatal error for a non-existant method, so I'm going to go ahead and that to my class too:


    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {

      public function testAddMonths() {
        $test_date = '2014-01-01';

        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);
        $date = $date_calc->getDate();
        $this->assertEquals($date, $test_date);

        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);
        $date_calc->addMonth();
        $date = $date_calc->getDate();
        $this->assertEquals($date, '2014-02-01');
      }
    }

    class DateCalc {

      public function __construct($date) {
        $this->date = $date;
      }

      public function getDate() {
        return $this->date;
      }

      public function addMonth() {

      }
    }

Now things are getting interesting. We've got an actual genuine logic failure here. As my addMonth method
 doesn't do anything yet, my assertion on the modified date is going to be wrong. So we go and add some logic to
 manipulate the dates. In doing so, we realise that we're going to need our value that we pass into our DateCalc
 class to become a DateTime object so we can work with it:

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {

      public function testAddMonths() {
        $test_date = '2014-01-01';

        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);
        $date = $date_calc->getDate();

        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);

      }

      public function addMonth() {
        $this->date->add(new DateInterval('P1M'));
      }
    }

Oops! We didn't refactor our test to pass in a valid DateTime object...

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {

      public function testAddMonths() {
        $test_date = new DateTime('2014-01-01');

And we're passing again - and now actually succeeding in testing adding a month to a given date
and verifying we get back what we expect. However, the weakness of our test is that we're only testing
one date, so we need to refactor some more to test more dates. In PHPUnit we can use Data Providers to
setup multiple test inputs and assertions on the same test:

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {

      /**
       * @dataProvider providerDates
       */
      public function testAddMonths($date, $result) {
        $test_date = new DateTime($date);

        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);
        $date_calc->addMonth();
        $date = $date_calc->getDate();
        $this->assertEquals($date, $result);
      }

      public function providerDates() {
        return array(
          array('2014-01-01', '2014-02-01'), // test our original values
          array('2014-01-15', '2014-02-15'), // test that mid month date works
          array('2014-01-31', '2014-02-28')  // test that end month date works
        );
      }
    }

    class DateCalc {

      public function __construct(DateTime $date) {
        $this->date = $date;
      }

      public function getDate() {
        return $this->date->format('Y-m-d');
      }

      public function addMonth() {
        $this->date->add(new DateInterval('P1M'));
      }
    }

If you read my previous post on calculating dates, you won't be surprise to see this has failed. PHP
has (debatably) incorrectly determined that adding one month to the 31st January takes us to the 2nd March.
My need is for us to return 28th Feb (or 29th if I'm in a leap year) so I need to add some logic to my addMonth
method to handle this. For the sake of brevity, I'm going to skip to a working solution, but in reality I went
through a few loops of code and test before eventually making my tests pass. All my changes were to the logic in the
DateCalc class though - once I'd setup my assertions in the test I didn't change them to force a test pass or that
would defeat the point.

And the result is:

    <?php

    class DateCalcTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {

      /**
       * @dataProvider providerDates
       */
      public function testAddMonths($date, $result) {
        $test_date = new DateTime($date);

        $date_calc = new DateCalc($test_date);
        $date_calc->addMonth();
        $date = $date_calc->getDate();
        $this->assertEquals($date, $result);
      }

      public function providerDates() {
        return array(
          array('2014-01-01', '2014-02-01'), // test our original values
          array('2014-01-15', '2014-02-15'), // test that mid month date works
          array('2014-01-31', '2014-02-28')  // test that end month date works
        );
      }
    }

    class DateCalc {

      public function __construct(DateTime $date) {
        $this->date = $date;
      }

      public function getDate() {
        return $this->date->format('Y-m-d');
      }

      public function addMonth() {
        $date = $this->date;
        $original_date = clone($date);
        $date = $date->add(new DateInterval('P1M'));

        if ($date->format('n') != ($original_date->format('n') + 1)) {
          $date->sub(new DateInterval( "P1M" ));
          $output_date = $date->format('Y-m-t');
        }
        else {
          $output_date = $date->format('Y-m-d');
        }

        $this->date = new DateTime($output_date);
      }
    }

    OK (3 tests, 3 assertions)

So there we have it, I'm successfully adding 1 month to a variety of dates, and getting back the
values that I expected, and I've built up the functionality as I go along supported by tests. I'm now
in a position where whenever I change the DateCalc code I can verify if I've introduced any regressions.

The observant among you will have spotted a few gaps in my tests and areas
that could be improved in the code examples:

* Updating the addMonth method to allow a variable number of months to be passed in
* Increasing test coverage to look at what happens when you're at the end of a year and
the date manipulation rolls into the following one
* Leap year tests

The bonus is, each successive refactor is now well placed to minimise the chances of introducing a regression,
because we now have the ability to run and update our tests which have been thought of from the outset - before
the code we've implemented can pollute our thinking of what possible tests we should write. The tests have driven
the code, not the other way around.
