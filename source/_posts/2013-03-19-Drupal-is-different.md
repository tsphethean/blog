summary: "Why is Drupal any different to any other development framework?"
---

I recently gave a presentation at Drupalcamp London and the Large Scale Drupal quarterly meetup (similar presentations but some refinements the second time round) about using Drupal for large scale development, not just in terms of developing for performance but also big in terms of team size, or complexity of the organisation you're developing in. I started with the premise that:

> "Developing big websites with Drupal is no different to developing them with any other software"

and then rationalised that to:

> "Drupal is no different to any other software"

And I still believe that in a world where we're convincing people to adopt Open Source technologies, we need to make people aware that just because open source gives you loads and loads for free, it doesn't mean it solves all your problems for you. You still need to put in place dev processes, CI, people investment, release management, etc, etc, etc...

Then, a few days ago, I was having a conversation over a beer with a friend who works in commercial software development working on proprietary software, trying to explain about Drupal, open source, and the community that surrounds it. He was struggling to understand, why should developers expect "free" time to spend on their hobby project of developing for Drupal (contrib or core)?

I've always tried to resist claims that Drupal developers are any different to developers of any other software, and that the inevitable discussions around contribution time, meetups, and other community commitments, are simply something I'd expect of any developer who was passionate about their technology. However, the more we talked, the more I became unsure.

Maybe Drupal is different.

Maybe it's an open source thing.

After all, how many times have developers hit upon a problem deep in the core of the product, unique to their use case, filed an issue with the product developers and sat and wait for the fix to surface. How many times does a problem get solved by someone in the community who happened to come across an issue in the issues queues, saw a chance message in IRC, or got talking to someone at a meetup - in all these cases, there's no incentive, no gain, no support contract to giving the answer, it's just a knowledge and passion of sharing knowledge and giving back to a community that has likely helped you at some time or other in a similar way.

And the last slide in my presentations?

> "Drupal is no different to any other software, *but the community is.*"

#### Bootnote

I believe all the good things I see in the Drupal community, that in my eyes make Drupal different, are most likely present in huge numbers of open source projects. Drupal is the project that's closest to me, that inspires me, and that I feel priviledged to be involved in, but really, Open Source, and the collaboration it fosters, is the real difference.
