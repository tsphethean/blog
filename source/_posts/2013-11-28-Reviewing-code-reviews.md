summary: "How to make sure your code reviews are effective"
---

A large part of my role, and that of any senior developer, is carrying out reviews
of the code written by the team to ensure that it meets coding standards for performance,
security, architectural principles, and adherance to the conventions of the framework or
platform being developed.

This can soon turn into a full time job in itself, and working round that volume of work
can lead to rushed or ignored reviews. I'd like to share a few things I've found useful
in avoiding this, and ensuring code reviews remain a valued and respected part of the development
process. My examples will largely focus on reviewing Drupal code, but easily apply
elsewhere.

#### Automate as much as possible

As with everything, the more you can automate, the less you have to do manually.

#### Keep the comments constructive

#### Share the burden

#### Encourage small changes, and small reviews
