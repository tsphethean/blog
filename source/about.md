## A bit about me...

I built my first website back in the heady days of 28k modems, Microsoft Publisher,
 and animated gifs. Thankfully, animated gifs are still going strong whilst Publisher
 has been consigned to the history books.

In terms of "real" websites, I've been developing and delivering websites and e-learning
since the early 2000s, dipping my toes into ASP.NET, Coldfusion and PHP along the way to becoming
increasingly interested in scale, performance and integration of platforms, and the
power of semantically composed content and strong information architecture.

Since hacking together my first PHP scripts, I've become a big advocate of Open Source
Software and the opportunities for both technical, social and economic growth that they
present. I joined the Drupal community in 2010, and have been consistently amazed by all
the interactions of a community which has created some fantastic software, and
continues to evolve it with each successive release.

I've been part of, and lead, developments large and small, and currently work as the Drupal Team
 Lead in Capgemini's Digital Services. I'm passionate about agile software delivery, the power
 of a team,

The thoughts I share on this site are purely my own, and don't reflect the views of Capgemini or
any of my other previous employers.
